# Personal Fitness Tracking Application

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Personal Fitness Tracking Application. This project is developed as part of the Programming with Python (MBA342B) course, conducted as part of my MBA program at CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Lavasa Pune.

## Project Overview
This Python application is designed for logging and tracking personal fitness activities. It offers functionalities such as:
- **User Authentication**: Allows users to log in or sign up, storing their details in a JSON file.
- **Workout Logging**: Users can log workout sessions, including exercise details, sets, reps, duration, and calories burned, which are saved to a CSV file.
- **Data Visualization**: Generates monthly workout summary charts and visual representations of workout statistics, like pie charts for common exercises and bar charts for calories burned.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use prompts for logging in, signing up, and inputting workout data.
- **Data Storage**: Efficient use of JSON and CSV files for storing user and workout data.
- **Visual Analytics**: Use of Matplotlib library for creating insightful charts and graphs.
